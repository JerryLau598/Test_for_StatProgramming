Here are the steps we want to realize using cmd or Terminal
1. Set up my new  repo and edit the default README.md
    * *Relatively easy to do*

2. Clone it using **Git**
    * Using the command `git clone + xxxx(The clone url)`

3. Add file to my local repo, edit it and add it to the files tracked by **Git**
    * In my repo I add a TeX setting file

4. Commit my edits and push
    * Using the command `git commit -a -m"The word you want to add"`
    * After commit, you need to use the command `git push` to synochorize the datas
    
5. Check the repo online, to see whether the online contains the added files
    * The new file indeed uploded into the repo

6. Sharing the repo
7.
