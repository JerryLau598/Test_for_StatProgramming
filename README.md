# Test_for_StatProgramming
This is a test demo for StatProgramming
---

Here are the steps we want to realize using cmd or Terminal
1. Set up my new  repo and edit the default README.md
    * *Relatively easy to do*

2. Clone it using **Git**
    * Using the command `git clone + xxxx(The clone url)`

3. Add file to my local repo, edit it and add it to the files tracked by **Git**
    * In my repo I add a TeX setting file

4. Commit my edits and push
    * Using the command `git commit -a -m"The word you want to add"`
    * After commit, you need to use the command `git push` to synochorize the datas
    
5. Check the repo online, to see whether the online contains the added files
    * The new file indeed uploded into the repo

6. Sharing the repo

7. TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED

8. When you go to the procedure git push and ask you to input the username and password, here the **password** is not the password of your account, it is the ** PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN**, where you can find them in the right upper corner -> setting -> Developer setting -> create your own token.
